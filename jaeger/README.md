# Zipkin tracing with Consul Service Mesh
This demo consists of three services Ingress (HTTP), Web (HTTP), and API (gRPC)  which are configured to communicate using Consul Service Mesh. 

```
ingress (HTTP) --
                  web (HTTP) --
                                api (gRPC, 20% error rate)
```

Tracing has been configured for both the application instances and Envoy proxy using the Zipkin protocol, the spans 
will be collected by the bundled Jaeger instance.

## Running the Demo
The demo can be started using Docker Compose with the following command:

```
consul-demo-tracing/jaeger on ÓÇ† master [?] via üêπ v1.13.1 on üê≥ v19.03.2
‚ûú docker-compose up

## Consul
Once running the consul UI is accessible at [http://localhost:8500](http://localhost:8500), you can also access the Consul API at the same address.
Service registration and the application of central config is applied when starting the application. The config files
can be found at the following locations:
* Consul Config [consul_config/config.hcl](consul_config/config.hcl)
* Central Config to set service protocol [central_config/](central_config/)
* Service Config for registering services and configuring upstreams [service_config/](service_config/)

## Interacting with the application
The main entry point for the system is accessible at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090), you can either 
interact with it using the UI [http://localhost:9090/ui](http://localhost:9090/ui).

![](images/fake-ui.png)

Or by directly curling the main service API:

```
consul-demo-tracing on ÓÇ† master [?] via üêπ v1.13.1
‚ûú curl localhost:9090
{
  "name": "Ingress",
  "uri": "/",
  "type": "HTTP",
  "start_time": "2019-10-10T20:10:11.590226",
  "end_time": "2019-10-10T20:10:11.630163",
  "duration": "39.9377ms",
  "body": "Hello World",
  "upstream_calls": [
    {
      "name": "Web",
      "uri": "http://localhost:9091",
      "type": "HTTP",
      "start_time": "2019-10-10T20:10:11.605254",
      "end_time": "2019-10-10T20:10:11.627063",
      "duration": "21.932ms",
      "body": "Web response",
      "upstream_calls": [
        {
          "name": "API",
          "uri": "grpc://localhost:9091",
          "type": "gRPC",
          "start_time": "2019-10-10T20:10:11.616201",
          "end_time": "2019-10-10T20:10:11.617864",
          "duration": "1.6636ms",
          "body": "API response",
          "code": 0
        }
      ],
      "code": 200
    }
  ],
  "code": 200
}
```

The API service has been configured to return an error approximately 20% of all calls.

## Tracing
The 3 services and their associated Envoy proxies are configured to emit tracing information in the Zipkin format which 
is collected by Jaeger. The Jaeger UI can be accessed at the following URL: [http://localhost:16686/search](http://localhost:16686/search).
